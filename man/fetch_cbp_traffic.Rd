research briefings view and the research briefings intranet view}
\usage{
fetch_cbp_traffic(start_date, end_date, internal = FALSE,
  by_date = FALSE, by_page = FALSE, combine = FALSE,
  merge_paths = FALSE, anti_sample = FALSE,
  use_resource_quotas = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_date}{The start date as an ISO 8601 string.}

\item{end_date}{The end date as an ISO 8601 string.}

\item{internal}{A boolean indicating whether to return only the results for
traffic from internal parliamentary networks. The default is FALSE.}

\item{by_date}{A boolean indicating whether to return the results broken
down by date. The default is FALSE.}

\item{by_page}{A boolean indicating whether to return the results broken
down by page. The default is FALSE.}

\item{combine}{A boolean indicating whether to combine the totals from
different properties or to report them separately. Note that combining the
traffic across properties can introduce errors in the number of users, as
the same user may visit pages on different properties. The default is
FALSE.}

\item{merge_paths}{A boolean indicating whether to aggregate figures for all
pages that have the same root path i.e. for all pages whose paths differ
only by their query strings or internal anchors. This parameter is ignored
if \code{by_page} is set to FALSE. Note that while merging paths is
necessary for analysis of individual pages it can introduce errors in the
number of users by page, as the same user may visit the same page through
URLs with different query strings and anchors. The default value is FALSE.}

\item{anti_sample}{A boolean indicating whether to use googleAnalyticsR's
anti-sample feature, which chunks API calls to keep the number of records
requested under the API limits that trigger sampling. This makes the
download process slower but ensures that all records are returned. Only
use this feature if you see that an API request triggers sampling without
it. The default is FALSE.}

\item{use_resource_quotas}{A boolean indicating whether to use the resource
quotas in Parliament's Google Analytics account to prevent sampling.
This is a faster and more effective way to disable sampling than using
\code{anti_sample}, but using resource quotas consumes tokens from a
limited daily quota. Use this when \code{anti_sample} still fails to
prevent sampling or is taking too long. Note that using resource quotas
takes precendence over anti-samping: if \code{use_resource_quotas} is TRUE
\code{anti_sample} is automatically set to FALSE. The default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A tibble of traffic metrics.
}
\description{
\code{fetch_cbp_traffic} downloads data on traffic metrics for all Commons
briefing papers on both the public Parliament website and the Parliamentary
intranet during the given dates and returns the data as a tibble.
}
\details{
By default, traffic figures are reported separately for each website
property in Google Analytics that contains some of the requested data. You
can use the \code{combine} argument to optionally combine traffic figures
so that each result appears only once with figures totalled across all
relevant properties. This makes it easier to produce aggregate figures for
traffic across a number of properties, but may introduce errors in the
number of users, as the same user may visit pages on different properties.

Traffic figures can be requested by page. Google Analytics treats webpages
requested with different query strings and section anchors as different
pages in its traffic data. You can use the \code{merge_paths} argument to
optionally sum the figures for pages with the same base path. This makes it
easier to calculcate the total number of views each distinct page has
received, but note that this may introduce errors in the number of users, as
a user may visit the same page using URLs with different query strings and
anchors.

If \code{combine} and \code{merge_paths} are both set to TRUE, rows for
different properties are combined before paths are merged.
